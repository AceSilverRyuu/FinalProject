            My Siblings

            <p>
              My older sister is 17 and has had ----- fish total.
               --- were guppies (Fillet, Sushi, Pickle, Relish, & tarter), 3 were adult betta (No names),
                and 2 were baby betta (Reeces & Ritz). All are dead.
                <br />
                Otherwise she has 2 winter white dwarf hamsters (Buiscuit & Pancake). They are still alive, unlike her fish.
                <br />
                <br />
                My younger brother is 12 and loves videogames. he plays them with our dad and his friends.
                Not much about him besides that he loves to feed my fish.
                <br />
                <br />
                My younger sister is 11 and can be quite annoying. She likes almost everything i like, but would never put her phone or tablet down to read a book.
